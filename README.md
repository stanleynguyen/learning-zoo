#LEARNING ZOO

An in-class understanding tracking system

###Problem we're trying to tackle:
- Students are sometimes too shy to voice their uncertainties over concepts that are taught in lecture
- Students as questions that majority of the class already captured, which wastes the class and lecturer's time
- Lecturers have no way to get analytics on whether their lessons are interesting, well-paced, easy to understand

###Getting started

Clone the repositories

```
git clone git@github.com:stanleynguyen/learning-zoo.git
```

Create a new branch with understandable name and create an upstream tracking branch on GitHub

```
git checkout -b <explanatory-branch-name>
git push --set-upstream origin <your-branch-name>
```

and start coding. When you are almost done, go to GitHub and [create a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) so everyone can review the code and discuss then merge.

Happy coding!!
